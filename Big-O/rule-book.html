Rule 1: Worst Case
    Always think of the worst case scenario to calculate the big 
    --> findNemo(fish)
        worst case: Nemo is at the last place in the array  

Rule 2: Remove constant
    Constant can be dropped while calculating the Big 0
    -->  Big O(3 + 4n) become  Big O(n)

 
Rule 3: Different terms for inputs 
    When there are different inputs, you should use different terms
    --> function compressFirstBpx(boxes, boxes2){
        console.log(boxes[0]) // Big O(a)
        console.log(boxes2[0]) // Big O(b)
    }
    Big O( a + b)

Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants
